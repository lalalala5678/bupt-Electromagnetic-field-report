Interface-induced dual-pinning mechanism enhances low-frequency electromagnetic wave loss,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47537-5,"Improving the absorption of electromagnetic waves at low-frequency bands (2-8 GHz) is crucial for the increasing electromagnetic (EM) pollution brought about by the innovation of the fifth generation (5G) communication technology. However, the poor impedance matching and intrinsic attenuation of material in low-frequency bands hinders the development of low-frequency electromagnetic wave absorbing (EMWA) materials. Here we propose an interface-induced dual-pinning mechanism and establish a magnetoelectric bias interface by constructing bilayer core-shell structures of NiFe2O4(NFO)@BiFeO3(BFO)@polypyrrole (PPy). Such heterogeneous interface could induce distinct magnetic pinning of the magnetic moment in the ferromagnetic NFO and dielectric pinning of the dipole rotation in PPy. The establishment of the dual-pinning effect resulted in optimized impedance and enhanced attenuation at low-frequency bands, leading to better EMWA performance. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) at thickness of 4.43 mm reaches -65.30 dB (the optimal absorption efficiency of 99.99997%), and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) can almost cover C-band (4.72 ~ 7.04 GHz) with low filling of 15.0 wt.%. This work proposes a mechanism to optimize low-frequency impedance matching with electromagnetic wave (EMW) loss and pave an avenue for the research of high-performance low-frequency absorbers.",2024

Focusing the electromagnetic field to 10−6λfor ultra-high enhancement of field-matter interaction,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26662-5,"Focusing electromagnetic field to enhance the interaction with matter has been promoting researches and applications of nano electronics and photonics. Usually, the evanescent-wave coupling is adopted in various nano structures and materials to confine the electromagnetic field into a subwavelength space. Here, based on the direct coupling with confined electron oscillations in a nanowire, we demonstrate a tight localization of microwave field down to 10−6λ. A hybrid nanowire-bowtie antenna is further designed to focus the free-space microwave to this deep-subwavelength space. Detected by the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, the field intensity and microwave-spin interaction strength are enhanced by 2.0 × 108and 1.4 × 104times, respectively. Such a high concentration of microwave field will further promote integrated quantum information processing, sensing and microwave photonics in a nanoscale system.",2021
Nondiffracting supertoroidal pulses and optical “Kármán vortex streets”,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48927-5,"Supertoroidal light pulses, as space-time nonseparable electromagnetic waves, exhibit unique topological properties including skyrmionic configurations, fractal-like singularities, and energy backflow in free space, which however do not survive upon propagation. Here, we introduce the non-diffracting supertoroidal pulses (NDSTPs) with propagation-robust skyrmionic and vortex field configurations that persists over arbitrary propagation distances. Intriguingly, the field structure of NDSTPs has a similarity with the von Kármán vortex street, a pattern of swirling vortices in fluid and gas dynamics with staggered singularities that can stably propagate forward. NDSTPs will be of interest as directed channels for information and energy transfer applications.",2024
An electromagnetic field disrupts negative geotaxis inDrosophilavia a CRY-dependent pathway,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5391,"Many higher animals have evolved the ability to use the Earth’s magnetic field, particularly for orientation.Drosophila melanogasteralso respond to electromagnetic fields (EMFs), although the reported effects are quite modest. Here we report that negative geotaxis in flies, scored as climbing, is disrupted by a static EMF, and this is mediated by cryptochrome (CRY), the blue-light circadian photoreceptor. CRYs may sense EMFs via formation of radical pairs of electrons requiring photoactivation of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) bound near a triad of Trp residues, but mutation of the terminal Trp in the triad maintains EMF responsiveness in climbing. In contrast, deletion of the CRY C terminus disrupts EMF responses, indicating that it plays an important signalling role. CRY expression in a subset of clock neurons, or the photoreceptors, or the antennae, is sufficient to mediate negative geotaxis and EMF sensitivity. Climbing therefore provides a robust and reliable phenotype for studying EMF responses inDrosophila.",2014
Resolving the electromagnetic mechanism of surface-enhanced light scattering at single hot spots,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms1674,"Light scattering at nanoparticles and molecules can be dramatically enhanced in the 'hot spots' of optical antennas, where the incident light is highly concentrated. Although this effect is widely applied in surface-enhanced optical sensing, spectroscopy and microscopy, the underlying electromagnetic mechanism of the signal enhancement is challenging to trace experimentally. Here we study elastically scattered light from an individual object located in the well-defined hot spot of single antennas, as a new approach to resolve the role of the antenna in the scattering process. We provide experimental evidence that the intensity elastically scattered off the object scales with the fourth power of the local field enhancement provided by the antenna, and that the underlying electromagnetic mechanism is identical to the one commonly accepted in surface-enhanced Raman scattering. We also measure the phase shift of the scattered light, which provides a novel and unambiguous fingerprint of surface-enhanced light scattering.",2012
Electromagnetic forming of AA1060 sheet based on mixed forces generated by a three-coil dual-power system,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-49590-4,"The electromagnetic force used in electromagnetic forming is mainly divided into attraction and repulsion. Dual-coil attractive electromagnetic forming can be used in the field of sheet pit repair. However, the magnetic field and eddy current generated by the two coils compete with each other, and the energy utilization rate is low. Therefore, a compensation coil is introduced, and an electromagnetic forming scheme of a three-coil dual-power sheet based on mixed force is proposed and verified by simulation. It is found that the three-coil mixed force can effectively improve the competition between the magnetic field and eddy current. The loading of the mixing force is not a simple superposition of attraction and repulsion, but the mutual promotion of the two. The forming displacement of the three-coil mixed force forming scheme is 582% higher than that of the dual-coil attraction forming scheme, and 89% higher than that of the attract first and then repel forming scheme. The forming effect of the three-coil mixing force is related to the number of turns of the compensation coil. The research results can improve the energy utilization rate of electromagnetic forming and provide a new idea for the loading scheme of electromagnetic forming force field.",2024
Magnetic-field tuning of the Casimir force,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02521-0,"The quantum fluctuation-induced Casimir force can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the dielectric permittivities and magnetic permeabilities of the materials involved. However, it is challenging to manipulate the dielectric permittivities of most materials using external fields. In contrast, the magnetic permeabilities of ferrofluids can be readily tuned by magnetic fields, which opens up the possibility of magnetic-field tuning of the Casimir force. Here, we demonstrate that this tuning can be achieved for a gold sphere and a silica plate immersed in water-based ferrofluids. Our theoretical calculations predict that, by varying the magnetic field, separation distance and ferrofluid volume fraction, the Casimir force can be tuned from attractive to repulsive over a wide range of parameters in this system. Experimentally, we develop a cantilever designed to conduct measurements within water-based ferrofluids. Using this setup, we observe the predicted transitions. These findings may lead to the development of switchable micromechanical devices based on the Casimir effect.",2024
Implementing an electromagnetic tracking navigation system improves the precision of endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy in an ex vivo model,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60647-w,"Endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy is crucial in the management of complications resulting from necrotizing pancreatitis. However, both real-time and visual-spatial information is lacking during the procedure, thereby jeopardizing a precise positioning of the endoscope. We conducted a proof-of-concept study with the aim of overcoming these technical difficulties. For this purpose, a three-dimensional (3D) phantom of a stomach and pancreatic necroses was 3D-printed based on spatial information from individual patient CT scans and subsequently integrated into a silicone torso. An electromagnetic (EM) sensor was adjusted inside the endoscope´s working channel. A software interface enabled real time visualization. The accuracy of this novel assistant system was tested ex vivo by four experienced interventional endoscopists who were supposed to reach seven targets inside the phantom in six different experimental runs of simulated endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy. Supported by endoscopic camera view combined with real-time 3D visualization, all endoscopists reached the targets with a targeting error ranging between 2.6 and 6.5 mm in a maximum of eight minutes. In summary, the EM tracking system might increase efficacy and safety of endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy at the experimental level by enhancing visualization. Yet, a broader feasibility study and further technical improvements are mandatory before aiming at implementation into clinical setting.",2024
Shaping metallic glasses by electromagnetic pulsing,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10576,"With damage tolerance rivalling advanced engineering alloys and thermoplastic forming capabilities analogous to conventional plastics, metallic glasses are emerging as a modern engineering material. Here, we take advantage of their unique electrical and rheological properties along with the classic Lorentz force concept to demonstrate that electromagnetic coupling of electric current and a magnetic field can thermoplastically shape a metallic glass without conventional heating sources or applied mechanical forces. Specifically, we identify a process window where application of an electric current pulse in the presence of a normally directed magnetic field can ohmically heat a metallic glass to a softened state, while simultaneously inducing a large enough magnetic body force to plastically shape it. The heating and shaping is performed on millisecond timescales, effectively bypassing crystallization producing fully amorphous-shaped parts. This electromagnetic forming approach lays the groundwork for a versatile, time- and energy-efficient manufacturing platform for ultrastrong metals.",2016

Continuity equation for the flow of Fisher information in wave scattering,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02519-8,"Using waves to explore our environment is a widely used paradigm, ranging from seismology to radar technology, and from biomedical imaging to precision measurements. In all these fields, the central aim is to gather as much information as possible about an object of interest by sending a probing wave at it and processing the information delivered back to a detector. Here we demonstrate that an electromagnetic wave scattered at an object carries locally defined and conserved information about all of the object’s constitutive parameters. Specifically, we introduce the density and flux of Fisher information for general types of wave fields and identify the corresponding sources and sinks of information through which all these new quantities satisfy a fundamental continuity equation. We experimentally verify our theoretical predictions by studying a movable object embedded in a disordered environment and by measuring the corresponding Fisher information flux at microwave frequencies. Our results improve the understanding of the generation and propagation of information and open up possibilities for tracking and designing the flow of information even in complex environments.",2024
All electromagnetic scattering bodies are matrix-valued oscillators,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43221-2,"Scattering theory is the basis of all linear optical and photonic devices, whose spectral response underpins wide-ranging applications from sensing to energy conversion. Unlike the Shannon theory for communication channels, or the Fano theory for electric circuits, understanding the limits of spectral wave scattering remains a notoriously challenging open problem. We introduce a mathematical scattering representation that inherently embeds fundamental principles of causality and passivity into its elemental degrees of freedom. We use this representation to reveal strong constraints in the mathematical structure of scattered fields, and to develop a general theory of the maximum radiative heat transfer in the near field, resolving a long-standing open question. Our approach can be seamlessly applied to high-interest applications across nanophotonics, and appears extensible to general classical and quantum scattering theory.",2023

Enhanced emergent electromagnetic inductance in Tb5Sb3due to highly disordered helimagnetism,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-024-01656-z,"In helimagnetic metals, ac current-driven spin motions can generate emergent electric fields acting on conduction electrons, leading to emergent electromagnetic induction (EEMI). Recent experiments reveal the EEMI signal generally shows a strongly current-nonlinear response. In this study, we investigate the EEMI of Tb5Sb3, a short-period helimagnet. Using small angle neutron scattering we show that Tb5Sb3hosts highly disordered helimagnetism with a distribution of spin-helix periodicity. The current-nonlinear dynamics of the disordered spin helix in Tb5Sb3indeed shows up as the nonlinear electrical resistivity (real part of ac resistivity), and even more clearly as a nonlinear and huge EEMI (imaginary part of ac resistivity) response. The magnitude of the EEMI reaches as large as several tens of μH for Tb5Sb3 devices on the scale of several tens of μm, originating to noncollinear spin textures possibly even without long-range helimagnetic order.",2024
Transverse photon spin of bulk electromagnetic waves in bianisotropic media,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-019-0521-4,"Photons possess spin degree of freedom, which plays an important role in various applications such as optical communications, information processing and sensing. In isotropic media, photon spin is aligned with the propagation direction of light, obeying the principle of spin momentum locking. Interestingly, surface waves decaying away from an interface have a photon spin transverse to its propagation, opening exciting opportunities for the observation of spin-dependent excitation in confined systems. Here, we propose and realize transverse photon spin (T-spin) in a bulk medium, without relying on the presence of any interfaces. We show the mapping of the T-spin of surface modes to that of the bulk modes by introducing bianisotropy into the medium. We further discover that the interface between two bianisotropic media of opposite orientations supports edge-dependent propagating modes with tunable cutoff frequencies. Our results provide a new platform for manipulating the spin–orbit interaction of electromagnetic waves.",2019

Narrowband electromagnetic emissions from Jupiter's magnetosphere,https://www.nature.com/articles/302385a0,"Recent studies of wideband plasma wave data from Voyagers 1 and 2 have revealed the existence of narrowband radio emissions escaping from Jupiter's magnetosphere in the frequency range 1–12 kHz. These narrowband emissions are very similar to narrowband emissions previously discovered near Earth and Saturn, and are believed to be produced by mode conversion from locally generated upper hybrid resonance waves at odd half-integral harmonics of the electron cyclotron frequency. This mode conversion process is believed to be one of the basic mechanisms for generating planetary radio emissions.",1983

Application of the Hall Effect in a Semi-conductor to the Measurement of Power in an Electromagnetic Field,https://www.nature.com/articles/173041a0,"IT is well known that if, in a piece of semi-conductor such as germanium or silicon, a magnetic field is set up along thez-axis, as defined by a Cartesian coordinate system, with current flow at right angles along they-axis, then an electromotive force appears, due to the Hall effect1along thex-axis. This electromotive force at any instant is given by:whereBis instantaneous flux density in gauss;Icis instantaneous current in amperes ;Ris Hall coefficient in volt. cm. per ampere gauss (for ‘n’ type germaniumRhas a value of about 8 × 10−5) ; andtis thickness in cm. along thez-axis of the sample of material exhibiting the Hall effect.

Importance of antennae for orientation of insects in a non-uniform microwave electromagnetic field,https://www.nature.com/articles/260522a0,"MICROWAVES can affect living organisms in different ways1. Radiation of high intensity is lethal, due to the thermal effect on the living tissues. Different organs are selectively sensitive both in vertebrates2and in insects3. Behavioural studies with rats have demonstrated that, in a choice situation, the animals will respond to an electromagnetic field of a rather low intensity, by leaving it4. Our investigations revealed that insects respond to the intensity gradient of a non-uniform microwave electromagnetic field in a similar way. In an arena illuminated by a non-uniform field insects carry out oriented movements avoiding the regions which are more intensely illuminated. In this paper we analyse the involvement of antennae in the orientation mechanisms underlying the avoidance response.",1976

Combining ultrahigh index with exceptional nonlinearity in resonant transition metal dichalcogenide nanodisks,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41566-024-01444-9,"Second-order nonlinearity in solids gives rise to a plethora of unique physical phenomena ranging from piezoelectricity and optical rectification to optical parametric amplification, spontaneous parametric down-conversion and the generation of entangled photon pairs. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, such as MoS2, exhibit one of the highest known second-order nonlinear coefficients. However, the monolayer nature of these materials prevents the fabrication of resonant objects exclusively from the material itself, necessitating the use of external structures to achieve the optical enhancement of nonlinear processes. Here we exploit the 3R phase of a molybdenum disulfide multilayer for resonant nonlinear nanophotonics. The lack of inversion symmetry—even in the bulk of the material—provides a combination of massive second-order susceptibility, extremely high and anisotropic refractive index in the near-infrared region (n> 4.5) and low absorption losses, making 3R-MoS2highly attractive for nonlinear nanophotonics. We demonstrate this by fabricating 3R-MoS2nanodisks of various radii, which support resonant anapole states, and observing substantial (>100-fold) enhancement of second-harmonic generation in a single resonant nanodisk compared with an unpatterned flake of the same thickness. The enhancement is maximized at the spectral overlap between the anapole state of the disk and the material resonance of the second-order susceptibility. Our approach unveils a powerful tool for enhancing the entire spectrum of optical second-order nonlinear processes in nanostructured van der Waals materials, thereby paving the way for nonlinear and quantum high-index transition metal dichalcogenide nanophotonics.",2024
Corner- and edge-mode enhancement of near-field radiative heat transfer,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07279-2,"It is well established that near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) can exceed Planck’s blackbody limit1by orders of magnitude owing to the tunnelling of evanescent electromagnetic frustrated and surface modes2,3,4, as has been demonstrated experimentally for NFRHT between two large parallel surfaces5,6,7and between two subwavelength membranes8,9. However, although nanostructures can also sustain a much richer variety of localized electromagnetic modes at their corners and edges10,11, the contributions of such additional modes to further enhancing NFRHT remain unexplored. Here we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally a physical mechanism of NFRHT mediated by the corner and edge modes, and show that it can dominate the NFRHT in the ‘dual nanoscale regime’ in which both the thickness of the emitter and receiver, and their gap spacing, are much smaller than the thermal photon wavelengths. For two coplanar 20-nm-thick silicon carbide membranes separated by a 100-nm vacuum gap, the NFRHT coefficient at room temperature is both predicted and measured to be 830 W m−2K−1, which is 5.5 times larger than that for two infinite silicon carbide surfaces separated by the same gap, and 1,400 times larger than the corresponding blackbody limit accounting for the geometric view factor between two coplanar membranes. This enhancement is dominated by the electromagnetic corner and edge modes, which account for 81% of the NFRHT between the silicon carbide membranes. These findings are important for future NFRHT applications in thermal management and energy conversion.",2024
On an electromagnetic calculation of ionospheric conductance that seems to override the field line integrated conductivity,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-58512-x,"The ionospheric conductance is the major quantity that determines the interaction of the magnetosphere with the ionosphere, where the magnetosphere is the large region of space affected by Earth’s geomagnetic field, and the ionosphere is its electrically conducting inner boundary, lying right on the edge of the atmosphere. Storms and substorms in space dissipate their energy through ionospheric currents, which heat the atmosphere and disrupt satellite orbits. The ionospheric conductance has, heretofore, been estimated using the staticized physics known as electrostatic theory, which finds that it can be computed by integrating the zero-frequency conductivity along the lines of Earth’s geomagnetic field. In this work we test this supposition by deriving an electromagnetic solution for collisional plasma, and applying it to obtain a first-ever fully-electromagnetic calculation of ionospheric conductance. We compare the results to the field line integrated conductivity, and find significant differences on all scales investigated. We find short-wavelength, mode-mixing, and wave-admittance effects that were completely unexpected. When this theoretical result is matched with recent observational findings for the scale of the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling-interaction, there results a situation where small- to intermediate-scale effects really may contribute to global modeling of the Sun-Earth system.",2024
Electromagnetic near-field mutual coupling suppression with active Janus sources,https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-024-01569-x,"Electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles are the most fundamental particles in electromagnetic theory. Huygens and Janus sources, formed by the orthogonal combination of electric and magnetic dipoles, both show good directionality in the near field. Although the Huygens source has been widely used in antennas and metasurfaces, the applications of Janus source are heretofore limited. In this paper we report the physical construction of an active Janus source. Through full-wave simulations within the parallel plate waveguide (PPW) environment, we show that our source achieves the directional electromagnetic near-field and quasi-isotropic far-field requisite of the Janus source. Using this fact, we demonstrate that two active Janus and Huygens sources in close proximity (about 0.10 to 0.25 wavelengths) achieve a near 1000-fold reduced mutual coupling compared to electric dipole sources. Particularly, the simultaneous achievement of strong mutual coupling suppression and quasi-isotropic radiation make the Janus source an ideal candidate for consideration in future compact multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems.",2024

Electromagnetic reprogrammable coding-metasurface holograms,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00164-9,"Metasurfaces have enabled a plethora of emerging functions within an ultrathin dimension, paving way towards flat and highly integrated photonic devices. Despite the rapid progress in this area, simultaneous realization of reconfigurability, high efficiency, and full control over the phase and amplitude of scattered light is posing a great challenge. Here, we try to tackle this challenge by introducing the concept of a reprogrammable hologram based on 1-bit coding metasurfaces. The state of each unit cell of the coding metasurface can be switched between ‘1’ and ‘0’ by electrically controlling the loaded diodes. Our proof-of-concept experiments show that multiple desired holographic images can be realized in real time with only a single coding metasurface. The proposed reprogrammable hologram may be a key in enabling future intelligent devices with reconfigurable and programmable functionalities that may lead to advances in a variety of applications such as microscopy, display, security, data storage, and information processing.",2017
Tailored compliant mechanisms for reconfigurable electromagnetic devices,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36143-6,"Reconfigurable electromagnetic devices, specifically reconfigurable antennas, have shown to be integral to the future of communication systems. However, mechanically robust designs that can survive real-world, harsh environment applications and high-power conditions remain rare to this day. In this paper, the general framework for a field of both discrete and continuously mechanically reconfigurable devices is established by combining compliant mechanisms with electromagnetics. To exemplify this new concept, a reconfigurable compliant mechanism antenna is demonstrated which exhibits continuously tunable performance across a broad band of frequencies. Moreover, three additional examples are also introduced that further showcase the versatility and advanced capabilities of compliant mechanism enabled electromagnetic devices. Unlike previous approaches, this is achieved with minimal part counts, additive manufacturing techniques, and high reliability, which mechanical compliant mechanism devices are known for. The results presented exemplify how compliant mechanisms have the capacity to transform the broader field of reconfigurable electromagnetic devices.",2023
Comparison of pulsed and continuous electromagnetic field generated by WPT system on human dermal and neural cells,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-56051-z,"In recent decades, we have seen significant technical progress in the modern world, leading to the widespread use of telecommunications systems, electrical appliances, and wireless technologies. These devices generate electromagnetic radiation (EMR) and electromagnetic fields (EMF) most often in the extremely low frequency or radio-frequency range. Therefore, they were included in the group of environmental risk factors that affect the human body and health on a daily basis. In this study, we tested the effect of exposure EMF generated by a new prototype wireless charging system on four human cell lines (normal cell lines—HDFa, NHA; tumor cell lines—SH-SY5Y, T98G). We tested different operating parameters of the wireless power transfer (WPT) device (87–207 kHz, 1.01–1.05 kW, 1.3–1.7 mT) at different exposure times (pulsed 6 × 10 min; continuous 1 × 60 min). We observed the effect of EMF on cell morphology and cytoskeletal changes, cell viability and mitotic activity, cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and oxidative stress. The results of our study did not show any negative effect of the generated EMF on either normal cells or tumor cell lines. However, in order to be able to estimate the risk, further population and epidemiological studies are needed, which would reveal the clinical consequences of EMF impact.",2024

Self-vectoring electromagnetic soft robots with high operational dimensionality,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-35848-y,"Soft robots capable of flexible deformations and agile locomotion similar to biological systems are highly desirable for promising applications, including safe human-robot interactions and biomedical engineering. Their achievable degree of freedom and motional deftness are limited by the actuation modes and controllable dimensions of constituent soft actuators. Here, we report self-vectoring electromagnetic soft robots (SESRs) to offer new operational dimensionality via actively and instantly adjusting and synthesizing the interior electromagnetic vectors (EVs) in every flux actuator sub-domain of the robots. As a result, we can achieve high-dimensional operation with fewer actuators and control signals than other actuation methods. We also demonstrate complex and rapid 3D shape morphing, bioinspired multimodal locomotion, as well as fast switches among different locomotion modes all in passive magnetic fields. The intrinsic fast (re)programmability of SESRs, along with the active and selective actuation through self-vectoring control, significantly increases the operational dimensionality and possibilities for soft robots.",2023

Direct observation of ideal electromagnetic fluids,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-32187-2,"Near-zero-index (NZI) media have been theoretically identified as media where electromagnetic radiations behave like ideal electromagnetic fluids. Within NZI media, the electromagnetic power flow obeys equations similar to those of motion for the velocity field in an ideal fluid, so that optical turbulence is intrinsically inhibited. Here, we experimentally observe the electromagnetic power flow distribution of such an ideal electromagnetic fluid propagating within a cutoff waveguide by a semi-analytical reconstruction technique. This technique provides direct proof of the inhibition of electromagnetic vorticity at the NZI frequency, even in the presence of complex obstacles and topological changes in the waveguide. Phase uniformity and spatially-static field distributions, essential characteristics of NZI materials, are also observed. Measurement of the same structure outside the NZI frequency range reveals existence of vortices in the power flow, as expected for conventional optical systems. Therefore, our results provide an important step forward in the development of ideal electromagnetic fluids, and introduce a tool to explore the subwavelength behavior of NZI media including fully vectorial and phase information.",2022
Improved adaptive regularization for simulated annealing inversion of transient electromagnetic,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-55710-5,"Geophysical inversion usually involves ill-posed problem. Regularization is the most commonly used method to mitigate this problem. There are many regularization parameter selection methods, among which the adaptive regularization method can automatically update parameters during iteration, reducing the difficulty of parameter selection. Therefore, it is widely used in linear inversion. However, there are very few studies on the use of adaptive regularization methods in stochastic optimization algorithms. The biggest difficulty is that in stochastic optimization algorithms, the search direction of any iteration is completely random. Data fitting term and stabilizing term vary in a wide range, making it difficult for traditional methods to work. In this paper, we consider the contributions of the data fitting term and the stabilizing term in the objective function and give an improved adaptive regularization method for very fast simulated annealing (VFSA) inversion for transient electromagnetic (TEM) data. The optimized method adjusts the two terms dynamically to make them in balance. We have designed several numerical experiments, and the experimental results demonstrate that the method in this paper not only accelerates the convergence, but also the inversion results are very little affected by the initial regularization parameter. Finally, we apply this method to field data, and the inversion results show very good agreements with nearby borehole data.",2024
Unique Huygens-Fresnel electromagnetic transportation of chiral Dirac wavelet in topological photonic crystal,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38325-8,"Light propagates in various ways depending on environment, including uniform medium, surface/interface and photonic crystals, which appears ubiquitously in daily life and has been exploited for advanced optics technology. We unveiled that a topological photonic crystal exhibits unique electromagnetic (EM) transport properties originating from the Dirac frequency dispersion and multicomponent spinor eigenmodes. Measuring precisely local Poynting vectors in microstrips of honeycomb structure where optics topology emerges upon a band gap opening in the Dirac dispersion and ap-dband inversion induced by a Kekulé-type distortion respectingC6vsymmetry, we showed that a chiral wavelet induces a global EM transportation circulating in the direction counter to the source, which is intimately related to the topological band gap specified by a negative Dirac mass. This brand-new Huygens-Fresnel phenomenon can be considered as the counterpart of negative refraction of EM plane waves associated with upwardly convex dispersions of photonic crystals, and our present finding is expected to open a new window for photonic innovations.",2023
Highly confined epsilon-near-zero and surface phonon polaritons in SrTiO3membranes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47917-x,"Recent theoretical studies have suggested that transition metal perovskite oxide membranes can enable surface phonon polaritons in the infrared range with low loss and much stronger subwavelength confinement than bulk crystals. Such modes, however, have not been experimentally observed so far. Here, using a combination of far-field Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and near-field synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) imaging, we study the phonon polaritons in a 100 nm thick freestanding crystalline membrane of SrTiO3transferred on metallic and dielectric substrates. We observe a symmetric-antisymmetric mode splitting giving rise to epsilon-near-zero and Berreman modes as well as highly confined (by a factor of 10) propagating phonon polaritons, both of which result from the deep-subwavelength thickness of the membranes. Theoretical modeling based on the analytical finite-dipole model and numerical finite-difference methods fully corroborate the experimental results. Our work reveals the potential of oxide membranes as a promising platform for infrared photonics and polaritonics.",2024

Electric field correlation measurements on the electromagnetic vacuum state,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1083-9,"Quantum mechanics ascribes to the ground state of the electromagnetic radiation1zero-point electric field fluctuations that permeate empty space at all frequencies. No energy can be extracted from the ground state of a system, and therefore these fluctuations cannot be measured directly with an intensity detector. The experimental proof of their existence therefore came from more indirect evidence, such as the Lamb shift2,3,4, the Casimir force between close conductors5,6,7or spontaneous emission1,8. A direct method of determining the spectral characteristics of vacuum field fluctuations has so far been missing. Here we perform a direct measurement of the field correlation on these fluctuations in the terahertz frequency range by using electro-optic detection9in a nonlinear crystal placed in a cryogenic environment. We investigate their temporal and spatial coherence, which, at zero time delay and spatial distance, has a peak value of 6.2 × 10−2volts squared per square metre, corresponding to a fluctuating vacuum field10,11of 0.25 volts per metre. With this measurement, we determine the spectral components of the ground state of electromagnetic radiation within the bandwidth of our electro-optic detection.",2019
Optimizing an electromagnetic wave absorber for bi-anisotropic metasurfaces based on toroidal modes,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-59503-8,"The design and optimization of an electromagnetic wave absorber for far-field wireless power transmission (WPT) is the subject of this research study. The goal of the research is to effectively absorb energy from ambient RF electromagnetic waves without the usage of a ground plane by employing metasurfaces with chiral components.By integrating trioidal moments into the design theory, the objective is to create a metasurface that functions in two frequency bands and produces high-quality resonance. The study also explores the dual non-homogeneity property of structures, polarization tensor coefficients, and the electromagnetic response of non-homogeneous metasurfaces. Based on the relative orientation of induced fields and moments, it delves deeper into the two basic possibilities for dual non-homogeneous elements. The development of chiral metasurfaces and the notion of electromagnetic chirality and its implications for polarization properties are introduced.",2024
Optical manipulation of the charge-density-wave state in RbV3Sb5,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07519-5,"Broken time-reversal symmetry in the absence of spin order indicates the presence of unusual phases such as orbital magnetism and loop currents1,2,3,4. The recently discovered kagome superconductors AV3Sb5(where A is K, Rb or Cs)5,6display an exotic charge-density-wave (CDW) state and have emerged as a strong candidate for materials hosting a loop current phase. The idea that the CDW breaks time-reversal symmetry7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14is, however, being intensely debated due to conflicting experimental data15,16,17. Here we use laser-coupled scanning tunnelling microscopy to study RbV3Sb5. By applying linearly polarized light along high-symmetry directions, we show that the relative intensities of the CDW peaks can be reversibly switched, implying a substantial electro-striction response, indicative of strong nonlinear electron–phonon coupling. A similar CDW intensity switching is observed with perpendicular magnetic fields, which implies an unusual piezo-magnetic response that, in turn, requires time-reversal symmetry breaking. We show that the simplest CDW that satisfies these constraints is an out-of-phase combination of bond charge order and loop currents that we dub a congruent CDW flux phase. Our laser scanning tunnelling microscopy data open the door to the possibility of dynamic optical control of complex quantum phenomenon in correlated materials.",2024

Supertoroidal light pulses as electromagnetic skyrmions propagating in free space,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26037-w,"Topological complex transient electromagnetic fields give access to nontrivial light-matter interactions and provide additional degrees of freedom for information transfer. An important example of such electromagnetic excitations are space-time non-separable single-cycle pulses of toroidal topology, the exact solutions of Maxwell’s equations described by Hellwarth and Nouchi in 1996 and recently observed experimentally. Here we introduce an extended family of electromagnetic excitation, the supertoroidal electromagnetic pulses, in which the Hellwarth-Nouchi pulse is just the simplest member. The supertoroidal pulses exhibit skyrmionic structure of the electromagnetic fields, multiple singularities in the Poynting vector maps and fractal-like distributions of energy backflow.

Modeling of electromagnetic propagation inside jet engine environment using statistical electromagnetic approach,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-53529-8,"In this paper, the distribution of the electromagnetic field inside a complex jet engine environment is analyzed using statistical electromagnetics. The jet engine environment is an extremely complex geometry and exhibits random behavior due to the presence of moving metallic parts. This renders traditional analytical and simulation modeling techniques highly inefficient. To address this issue, two different approaches are proposed to model the propagation characteristics of the jet engine environment. The first is an innovative dynamic system approach based on dynamic system simulation which is inspired by the analysis of mechanically stirred reverberation chambers. In the dynamic system simulation the dynamic system, which is characterized by the rotation of a distinct set of blades, is primarily studied through the simulation program. A dimension scaling method is also introduced along with the dynamic system simulation to solve the complex jet engine environment. In the second approach, a novel statistical excitation method is applied to develop an equivalent model for the dynamic jet engine system. The studied jet engine is considered as a static jet engine system without blade rotation (static blades), but with a random excitation.A small signal analysis method is used to integrate the static and dynamic system parameters to generate random excitation characteristics of the static system. The extracted electric field values from the dynamic jet engine simulation environment and the static system field values from the small signal analysis have been analyzed statistically to prove the statistical equality between the two systems. The numerical results of the static system model are presented and verified through comparison with finite element method simulation packages.",2024
